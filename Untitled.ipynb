And then another. Afghanistan, who were fresh from levelling India\\'s mammoth 212 in the 20 overs, rode the adrenaline against Mukesh Kumar in the first Super Over, getting 16 runs from it.     India hit back by equalising that and dragging the fixture into another Super Over. However, when Afghanistan\\'s Mohammad Nabi and Rahmanullah Gurbaz walked out, the target of 11 runs looked rather easy to get given how well Afghanistan had flexed their big-hitting muscles all evening. Nabi, who took strike, in particular was brutal during the chase with a 27-ball 42.     Rohit took a massive punt by throwing the ball to Ravi Bishnoi, and the leg spinner earned his captain some sweet vindication. Rahul Dravid later lauded the skipper for taking a positive gut call in such a crunch situation to secure the game.        \"I think Rohit went with his gut, he went with a call... I think he felt that the spinner had a better chance to take those two wickets. It was one of games when 11 wasn\\'t probably a huge score and where you know that if they batted those six balls, with the power they had, they probably would\\'ve got the 12 runs. You needed to take two wickets,\" Dravid said.     Bishnoi did just that by pulling his lengths back and making it hard for the batters to clear the boundaries even in a venue like the Chinnaswamy stadium.     \"The pressure was there, the heartbeat was racing, but I was confident about getting the job done. I was told by the captain that I\\'ll bowl - I knew it wouldn\\'t be easy for them if I bowl back of the length ball, it would be tough to smash on the back-foot. It gives a lot of pleasure to defend during the super overs,\" the leg-spinner said at the presentation ceremony.     Dravid echoed those thoughts, praising both Rohit - for taking the decision - and Bishnoi - for pulling off those lengths accurately.     \"I think it was a great call from the skipper to go with the spinner,\" Dravid said. \"He could\\'ve gone for two sixes but I thought Bishnoi was brilliant, because he bowled two superb balls. He pulled the length back... if the length had gone slightly fuller, the way they were batting, on this small ground it would\\'ve gone for a six. I think it was really good gut call from Rohit to go for the wickets and be more positive rather than probably a safer option which people would\\'ve expected.\"     Before the proceedings culminated in such a sequence of events, there was a brief moment of confrontation during the first Super Over. On the last ball, Mohammad Nabi swung and missed a full ball but dashed off for a run. Sanju Samson\\'s underarm throw from behind ricocheted off Nabi\\'s leg and the two Afghanistan batters picked a couple of more runs, much to the annoyance of Rohit and Virat Kohli. Rohit even had a word with Nabi who didn\\'t seem to see any issue with what had transpired as three runs were added to Afghanistan\\'s total. Dravid played down the incident as being part of a game such as this where emotions ran high.     \"It\\'s fine. It\\'s part of the game. Some frustrations at times can happen but it is okay. It hit the non-striker and then it moved and I think it is fine, you know, you can run for those,\" Dravid opined. \"To be honest, in the first T20I there was an incident where it hit the bat of our batsman and we ran a run as well. I think there\\'s nothing to read into, there\\'s nothing in the rules that stops you from actually running those runs. That\\'s fine, it\\'s part of the game.\"     \"It can happen at the end. I think sometimes when you play for your country, there\\'s so much passion and emotion. I think it is incredible that even in dead-rubber games when it gets down to the wire, that competitiveness comes out, that passion comes out,\" Dravid added, lauding the show of passion from both sides.     \"As long as it doesn\\'t cross the line... that\\'s why we have match referees and people who are there to look at these things. I think sometimes a little bit of that passion and emotion is really important. It shows that people care. I think as long as it doesn\\'t cross the line, it\\'s great.\"    © Cricbuzz   ShareTweet   TAGS    Afghanistan tour of India, 2024     Afghanistan tour of India, 2024, 3rd T20I     RELATED STORIESRohit Sharma in first Super Over: Retired out or Retired not-out?

updated on     ShareTweet         Bishnoi picked two in the final Super Over   BCCI     A game that saw     runs scored across    overs at the Chinnaswamy stadium in Bengaluru came down to a Super Over  And then another  Afghanistan  who were fresh from levelling India s mammoth     in the    overs  rode the adrenaline against Mukesh Kumar in the first Super Over  getting    runs from it      India hit back by equalising that and dragging the fixture into another Super Over  However  when Afghanistan s Mohammad Nabi and Rahmanullah Gurbaz walked out  the target of    runs looked rather easy to get given how well Afghanistan had flexed their big hitting muscles all evening  Nabi  who took strike  in particular was brutal during the chase with a    ball         Rohit took a massive punt by throwing the ball to Ravi Bishnoi  and the leg spinner earned his captain some sweet vindication  Rahul Dravid later lauded the skipper for taking a positive gut call in such a crunch situation to secure the game          I think Rohit went with his gut  he went with a call    I think he felt that the spinner had a better chance to take those two wickets  It was one of games when    wasn t probably a huge score and where you know that if they batted those six balls  with the power they had  they probably would ve got the    runs  You needed to take two wickets   Dravid said      Bishnoi did just that by pulling his lengths back and making it hard for the batters to clear the boundaries even in a venue like the Chinnaswamy stadium       The pressure was there  the heartbeat was racing  but I was confident about getting the job done  I was told by the captain that I ll bowl   I knew it wouldn t be easy for them if I bowl back of the length ball  it would be tough to smash on the back foot  It gives a lot of pleasure to defend during the super overs   the leg spinner said at the presentation ceremony      Dravid echoed those thoughts  praising both Rohit   for taking the decision   and Bishnoi   for pulling off those lengths accurately       I think it was a great call from the skipper to go with the spinner   Dravid said   He could ve gone for two sixes but I thought Bishnoi was brilliant  because he bowled two superb balls  He pulled the length back    if the length had gone slightly fuller  the way they were batting  on this small ground it would ve gone for a six  I think it was really good gut call from Rohit to go for the wickets and be more positive rather than probably a safer option which people would ve expected       Before the proceedings culminated in such a sequence of events  there was a brief moment of confrontation during the first Super Over  On the last ball  Mohammad Nabi swung and missed a full ball but dashed off for a run  Sanju Samson s underarm throw from behind ricocheted off Nabi s leg and the two Afghanistan batters picked a couple of more runs  much to the annoyance of Rohit and Virat Kohli  Rohit even had a word with Nabi who didn t seem to see any issue with what had transpired as three runs were added to Afghanistan s total  Dravid played down the incident as being part of a game such as this where emotions ran high       It s fine  It s part of the game  Some frustrations at times can happen but it is okay  It hit the non striker and then it moved and I think it is fine  you know  you can run for those   Dravid opined   To be honest  in the first T  I there was an incident where it hit the bat of our batsman and we ran a run as well  I think there s nothing to read into  there s nothing in the rules that stops you from actually running those runs  That s fine  it s part of the game        It can happen at the end  I think sometimes when you play for your country  there s so much passion and emotion  I think it is incredible that even in dead rubber games when it gets down to the wire  that competitiveness comes out  that passion comes out   Dravid added  lauding the show of passion from both sides       As long as it doesn t cross the line    that s why we have match referees and people who are there to look at these things  I think sometimes a little bit of that passion and emotion is really important  It shows that people care  I think as long as it doesn t cross the line  it s great        Cricbuzz   ShareTweet   TAGS    Afghanistan tour of India           Afghanistan tour of

And then another. Afghanistan, who were fresh from levelling India's mammoth 212 in the 20 overs, rode the adrenaline against Mukesh Kumar in the first Super Over, getting 16 runs from it.     India hit back by equalising that and dragging the fixture into another Super Over. However, when Afghanistan's Mohammad Nabi and Rahmanullah Gurbaz walked out, the target of 11 runs looked rather easy to get given how well Afghanistan had flexed their big-hitting muscles all evening. Nabi, who took strike, in particular was brutal during the chase with a 27-ball 42.     Rohit took a massive punt by throwing the ball to Ravi Bishnoi, and the leg spinner earned his captain some sweet vindication. Rahul Dravid later lauded the skipper for taking a positive gut call in such a crunch situation to secure the game.        \"I think Rohit went with his gut, he went with a call... I think he felt that the spinner had a better chance to take those two wickets. It was one of games when 11 wasn't probably a huge score and where you know that if they batted those six balls, with the power they had, they probably would've got the 12 runs. You needed to take two wickets,\" Dravid said.     Bishnoi did just that by pulling his lengths back and making it hard for the batters to clear the boundaries even in a venue like the Chinnaswamy stadium.     \"The pressure was there, the heartbeat was racing, but I was confident about getting the job done. I was told by the captain that I'll bowl - I knew it wouldn't be easy for them if I bowl back of the length ball, it would be tough to smash on the back-foot. It gives a lot of pleasure to defend during the super overs,\" the leg-spinner said at the presentation ceremony.     Dravid echoed those thoughts, praising both Rohit - for taking the decision - and Bishnoi - for pulling off those lengths accurately.     \"I think it was a great call from the skipper to go with the spinner,\" Dravid said. \"He could've gone for two sixes but I thought Bishnoi was brilliant, because he bowled two superb balls. He pulled the length back... if the length had gone slightly fuller, the way they were batting, on this small ground it would've gone for a six. I think it was really good gut call from Rohit to go for the wickets and be more positive rather than probably a safer option which people would've expected.\"     Before the proceedings culminated in such a sequence of events, there was a brief moment of confrontation during the first Super Over. On the last ball, Mohammad Nabi swung and missed a full ball but dashed off for a run. Sanju Samson's underarm throw from behind ricocheted off Nabi's leg and the two Afghanistan batters picked a couple of more runs, much to the annoyance of Rohit and Virat Kohli. Rohit even had a word with Nabi who didn't seem to see any issue with what had transpired as three runs were added to Afghanistan's total. Dravid played down the incident as being part of a game such as this where emotions ran high.     \"It's fine. It's part of the game. Some frustrations at times can happen but it is okay. It hit the non-striker and then it moved and I think it is fine, you know, you can run for those,\" Dravid opined. \"To be honest, in the first T20I there was an incident where it hit the bat of our batsman and we ran a run as well. I think there's nothing to read into, there's nothing in the rules that stops you from actually running those runs. That's fine, it's part of the game.\"     \"It can happen at the end. I think sometimes when you play for your country, there's so much passion and emotion. I think it is incredible that even in dead-rubber games when it gets down to the wire, that competitiveness comes out, that passion comes out,\" Dravid added, lauding the show of passion from both sides.     \"As long as it doesn't cross the line... that's why we have match referees and people who are there to look at these things. I think sometimes a little bit of that passion and emotion is really important. It shows that people care. I think as long as it doesn't cross the line, it's great.\"    © Cricbuzz   Share Tweet   TAGS    Afghanistan tour of India, 2024     Afghanistan tour of India, 2024, 3rd T20I     RELATED STORIES Rohit Sharma in first Super Over: Retired out or Retired not-out?
